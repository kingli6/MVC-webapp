### TODO TOYellowDuck
- Naming Course differently? Class model and other areas have singular course. 
  But in CourseContext class, I use Courses, and it's confusing. I'm changing it to CourseDbSet for now.
- How do change the page to https from http
-I can't create data through PUT method in postman, but it works on Swagger...
